## Create your copy of the repo

A sample application, called Goof, is provided for this workshop as a GitHub template. Navigate to the [GitHub Repo for the Goof application](https://github.com/snyk-partners/goof) and click "Use this Template" and then "Create a new repository" to create a copy of the Repo to your personal GitHub account.

Be sure to name the new Repo `goof` otherwise things will break later on.

We recommend you make your copy have "public" visibility, it will simplify working with it during this workshop.

To copy-paste the commands in the instructions set an environment variable with your GitHub ID. Your GitHub ID is displayed in the upper right corner in [GitHub.com](github.com). Replace the REPLACE_ME value with your GitHub ID.

```sh
GithubId=REPLACE_ME
```

## Clone the repo
After you create the Repo, clone the Repo to your VS Code Server environment by using the `git clone` command. Once the clone completes, change to the repo's top level directory. 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/$GithubId/goof && cd goof
```

This copies the Repo files to your VS Code Server environment. 


## Run setup scripts
If you are running this workshop through an AWS Hosted Event, these tools have already been installed. However if you are self-paced, there are a couple of setup scripts in the `cloud9-setup` directory (note: despite the name, these scripts should be run in your VS Code Server environment) you should run:

### Tool setup
The `setup.sh` script installs and/or updates the following tools:

* kubectl (including aliasing it to `k` and setting up bash-completion)
* awscli
* jq
* yq
* pngcrush

```sh
cd cloud9-setup
./setup.sh
. ~/.bashrc #source the ~/.bashrc to make sure all environment settings are in place
```
